# HR-Distribution-Dashboard
This project is an HR Analytics Dashboard created using Power BI and MySQL. It provides insights into employee demographics, job distribution
and other key HR metrics such as:

Gender Distribution: Breakdown of employees by gender.
Age Group Distribution: Employees grouped into different age categories.
Department Analysis: The top departments with the most employees and gender breakdown.
Remote vs Headquarters: Comparison of employees working remotely versus those at headquarters.
Race Distribution: An overview of the racial diversity within the company.
Employee Termination Rates: Analysis of termination rates across various departments.

The data was cleaned and transformed using MySQL, and key metrics were visualized through Power BI. The project showcases my ability to work with databases and visualization tools to derive meaningful insights from HR data.
